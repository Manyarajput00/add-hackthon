                <h2>1. Education and Awareness
                </h2>
                <p class="description">
                    One of the biggest challenges neurodiverse individuals face is societal misunderstanding. Schools, workplaces, and communities must increase awareness about neurodiversity through training and education. By dispelling myths and stereotypes, people can move away from viewing neurodivergence as a "deficit" and start recognizing the strengths it brings.

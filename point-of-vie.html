                </h2>
                <p class="description">
                    To advocates, neurodivergent individuals are seen as uniquely talented and valuable members of society. They celebrate their different ways of thinking, problem-solving, and perceiving the world. These individuals push for inclusivity, encouraging workplaces, schools, and social spaces to accommodate and embrace neurodiversity. They recognize the struggles but focus on strengths, seeing neurodivergent minds as essential for innovation and creativity.

                <h2>2. The Misunderstanding Majority
                </h2>
                <p class="description">Some people, unaware of neurodiversity or lacking firsthand experience, may view neurodivergent individuals with confusion. They might see their behaviors as odd, difficult, or even disruptive. These individuals often rely on stereotypes, equating neurodivergence solely with disability rather than a spectrum of abilities. Their perspective is not necessarily negative but shaped by a lack of awareness.

                <h2>3. The Traditionalists</h2>
                <p class="description">
                    For those who adhere to conventional societal norms, neurodivergent individuals may be perceived as needing to "adapt" or "overcome" their differences. They might see neurodiversity as a challenge rather than a natural variation in human cognition. This viewpoint often manifests in efforts to "normalize" behavior rather than accommodate it, leading to expectations that neurodivergent individuals conform rather than thrive in their own ways.

                    <h2>4. The Skeptics</h2>
                    <p class="description">
                        There are those who remain skeptical about the concept of neurodiversity, viewing it as an overused label or an excuse for behaviors they consider unusual. They may question diagnoses or dismiss the need for accommodations, believing everyone should function under the same expectations. This perspective often arises from a rigid understanding of intelligence and success.

                    5. The Compassionate Observers</h2>
                <p class="description">
                    Many people, even without deep knowledge of neurodiversity, take a compassionate stance. They recognize that neurodivergent individuals experience the world differently and may require support, patience, and understanding. They may not fully grasp the complexities but are open to learning and adapting to be more inclusive.

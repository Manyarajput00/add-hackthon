    <h2>What is Neurodiversity?</h2>
    <p>
      Neurodiversity is the concept that neurological differences, such as autism, ADHD, dyslexia, and other cognitive conditions, are natural variations of the human brain. These differences should not be viewed as disorders, but as part of the diversity of human experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      Neurodiverse individuals may think, process, and react differently than others. Their unique cognitive styles can lead to strengths like creativity, problem-solving skills, and attention to detail, but they can also face challenges in conventional settings like schools or workplaces.
    </p>

    <h2>Challenges Faced by Neurodiverse Individuals</h2>

      <li><strong>Communication Barriers:</strong> Challenges in expressing thoughts or understanding verbal or non-verbal cues.</li>
      <li><strong>Education System:</strong> Schools and educational systems often lack accommodations to support different learning styles, making it difficult for neurodiverse students to thrive.</li>

    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Embracing Uniqueness:</strong> Instead of viewing their differences as limitations, neurodiverse individuals may view them as unique qualities that contribute to the world in special ways.</li>
      <li><strong>Building Self-Awareness:</strong> Understanding their own needs and triggers helps neurodiverse individuals navigate the world around them with greater ease.</li>
      <li><strong>Seeking Support:</strong> They often rely on support from family, friends, or therapists who understand their needs and can offer guidance.</li>
      <li><strong>Focusing on Strengths:</strong> Many neurodiverse individuals concentrate on their strengths, whether it's creativity, problem-solving, or attention to detail, and use these abilities to their advantage in both personal and professional life.</li>
